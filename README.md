# Bookstore

>The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. You will create an MVP version of it that allows you to:

- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.

>By building this application, you will learn how to use React and Redux.
>You will need to build a website with two subpages: "Books" and "Categories." However, you will only need to implement the "Books" part (see the image below). The "Categories" page will stay empty in this MVP.
