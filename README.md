# Bookstore: add reducers and actions

>The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. You will create an MVP version of it that allows you to:

- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.

>In this step, I configured my Redux Store and write actions and reducer for adding and removing books.
